# Postlight Task Frontend

Here is the task asked of me for Postlight company <br>
All tech stacks asked in the description are used
##Start the app

The frontend tech stack is:
reactjs 
context api

# install dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```

When the done run 
```bash
$ npm start
```


Now that the application is running you can open it on localhost:3000 or 3001 if the backend is on 3000

<hr>

I am using the context api with react hooks to make the authentication work

You can sign in and sign up and the user will be added to the employees list
In the home page you can see all employees with 10 per page limit and with a search input where you can choose which field to search with
